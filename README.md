#   Instagram Data Analyzer
A Python-Based Desktop program that lets the user see who followed and unfollowed them.
The app also allows the users to compare the users who follow them to the last time that app was ran.
Another useful future is that the users can save their profiles on the app to run the app hassle-free next time.
